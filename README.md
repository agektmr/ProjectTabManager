Project Tab Manager is an extension for Google Chrome that helps you focus on a single project. It preserves each windows as projects, not only you can restore them anytime, you can synchronize projects across different devices using same Chrome profile.

## Getting Started
PTM automatically tracks all windows you open in Chrome. You can resume those windows anytime you want. See how it works:

1. Click on PTM icon  
<div class="img">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agektmr/ProjectTabManager/master/assets/readme_0.png" style="width:227px; height:46px;" />
</div>
2. Do you see a list of dates? They represent sessions per window. Try closing one of the window, you'll be able to restore the window and its tabset by clicking on the session entry.  
<div class="img">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agektmr/ProjectTabManager/master/assets/readme_1.png" style="width:321px; height:181px;" />
</div>
3. You can create a project out of the session by clicking on the folder icon next to the session name.  
<div class="img">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agektmr/ProjectTabManager/master/assets/readme_3.png" style="width:290px; height:269px;" />
</div>
4. Check out Chrome's bookmark folder. The project is stored as Chrome's standard bookmarks. So they are synced across devices and even accessible from Chrome for Android or for iOS.  
<div class="img">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agektmr/ProjectTabManager/master/assets/readme_5.png" style="width:533px; height:111px;" />
</div>
5. The stars indicate if they are temporary sessions or synced bookmarks. Adding / modifying tab's URLs will be locally tracked, but not synced. Add stars to sync.  
<div class="img">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agektmr/ProjectTabManager/master/assets/readme_6.png" style="width:320px; height:207px;" />
</div>
6. Feel free to close the window. You can restore the state anytime!

## 1 rule to remember:
- **Close windows not tabs unless you want it to be forgotten.**

## Keyboard Navigation

- You can navigate through PTM using keyboard.
    - **`tab`:** selects next project.
    - **`return`:** opens the selected project.
    - **`right arrow`:** expands project folder
    - **`left arrow`:** folds project folder
- If you want to open PTM with a short cut key, open "chrome://extensions" and go to bottom of the page to find "Keyboard shortcuts" then assign. The default key combination is `ctrl+P`.
- `shift` + click on a project will open the project then close the open window
