# Welcome to Project Tab Manager!

Thank you for installing Project Tab Manager.

- Have you been opening 100 tabs on your Chrome?
- Consuming lots of memory just with Chrome?
- Distracted by social network while you are working?

Worry no more! Project Tab Manager (PTM) helps you solve those problems!

## Getting Started
PTM automatically tracks all windows you open in Chrome. You can resume those windows anytime you want. See how it works:

### 1. Click on PTM icon

### 2. Do you see list of dates? They are projects and represents windows!

### 3. You can name it more comprehensive manner by clicking on pencil icon next to the project name.

### 4. Change the name. It looks more like a project, doesn't it?

### 5. Clicking on stars stores the page permanently. This will persist and works across devices including mobile Chrome.

### 6. Because those pages are stored as bookmarks in &quot;Other Bookmarks&quot; (default).

### 7. Opaque pages mean "bookmarked but not opened". So you can recover it anytime.

### There are just 2 rules to remember:
- **Closing window enables you to resume project status whenever you want**
- **Closing a tab eliminates the page from the project unless you star it**

## Further Instructions
### Removing Projects
- By clicking on garbage icon beside project name removes the project.
- Removed bookmarks will be moved to a special folder named "__Archives__". They are not deleted, but pages that are not bookmarked will be removed permanently.
- Delete folders and bookmarks under "__Archives__" manually if you think they are not important.

### Lazy Loading
- Opening a lot of tabs may take a while and consumes memory on Chrome. Lazy Loading feature on PTM enables you to delay actual rendering of those tabs.
- Lazy loaded tabs will have title with "*" prefixed. They won't be loaded until you will activate them.
- You have an option to turn lazy loading feature off.

### Options
- In [Options page](#/options), you can configure
    - Root bookmark folder of PTM
    - Root bookmark folder name
    - Lazy Loading switch

### Summary
- By clicking on clock icon on top of PTM pop up, you can see [summary of time you spent on each projects](#/summary).
- These summaries are stored for 2 month so that you can come back and see how much time you spent on which project.

### Keyboard Navigation

- You can navigate through PTM using keyboard.
    - **tab:** selects next project.
    - **return:** opens the selected project.
    - **right arrow:** expands project folder
    - **left arrow:** folds project folder
- If you want to open PTM with a short cut key, open "chrome://extensions" and go to bottom of the page to find "Keyboard shortcuts" then assign.
